# User-Based Integrations Feature

## Feature Brief

### Vision
Transform the Integration Monitor from a public feed aggregator into a secure, multi-user platform where each user can manage their own private collection of integration RSS feeds.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Personal Workspace**: Each user gets their own dashboard with private integrations
- **Data Security**: User data is isolated and protected through authentication
- **Future-Ready**: Architected to support team collaboration and integration sharing

### Key Requirements
1. **User Authentication**: Email/password login with Supabase Auth
2. **Data Isolation**: Each user only sees and manages their own integrations  
3. **Secure Access**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
4. **Future Extensibility**: Database design supports future group sharing features

## Database Schema Changes

### New Migration Script
```sql
-- Add user_id to existing tables
ALTER TABLE feeds ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE feed_items ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Create user_groups table for future sharing functionality
CREATE TABLE user_groups (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  owner_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE user_group_members (
  group_id UUID REFERENCES user_groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT DEFAULT 'member' CHECK (role IN ('owner', 'admin', 'member')),
  joined_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (group_id, user_id)
);

-- Update RLS policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access on feeds" ON feeds;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public insert access on feeds" ON feeds;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public update access on feeds" ON feeds;

CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own feeds" ON feeds 
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can only insert their own feeds" ON feeds 
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can only update their own feeds" ON feeds 
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Similar policies for feed_items
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access on feed_items" ON feed_items;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public insert access on feed_items" ON feed_items;

CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own feed_items" ON feed_items 
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can only insert their own feed_items" ON feed_items 
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. **App Load**: Check for existing session
2. **Unauthenticated**: Redirect to beautiful `/login` page
3. **Authentication**: Clear login/signup tabs with proper validation
4. **Authenticated**: Redirect to dashboard with user-specific data

### Data Access Pattern
- All database operations filtered by `auth.uid()`
- React Query keys include user ID for proper cache isolation
- RLS policies enforce server-side security

### Key Components
- `AuthProvider`: Manages auth state across app
- `AuthGuard`: Wraps protected routes
- `LoginPage`: Beautiful split-screen auth UI with tabs
- Updated data hooks with user context

- Users can create groups and invite others
- Integrations can be shared with specific groups
- Role-based permissions (owner, admin, member)

### Additional Auth Features (Future)
- Social login (Google, GitHub)
- Two-factor authentication
- Session management and device tracking
- Advanced user profile management
